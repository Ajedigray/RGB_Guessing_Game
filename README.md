# RGB_Guessing_Game

## Introduction

Udemy - Colt Steele: The Web Developer Course

I used the JavaScript and CSS skills I learned from Colt Steele's web developer course on udemy.com to create this application.
This application is a guessing game in which the user is given a specific color and has to guess what the color is by choosing from  the given squares.
There are two difficulties: Easy and Hard.
This application requires an internet browser such as: Google Chrome or Safari.

## Content

1. `colorGame.html` - website markup
2. `css/colorGame.css` - website styling
3. `js/colorGame.css` - website behavior
4. `README.md` - Documentation for project

## Operating Instructions

Pull RGB_Guessing_Game repository from my gitHub account
Using Terminal: run `open -a "Google Chrome" colorGame.html`

1. The page will load the game
2. Click on one square at a time to guess
3. Click "More Colors" to reset the game
4. Click  "Play Again" to start a new game
5. Toggle Between "Easy" and "Hard" to set game difficulty
